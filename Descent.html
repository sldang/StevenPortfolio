            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Descent Into Darkness is a fictional Dreamscape VR experience developed by a team of six students, structured as a full campaign from initial thumbnails to final pitch. 
                As Art Director, the focus was on visual cohesion and momentum: leading critiques, organizing meetings, managing deadlines, and channeling feedback from the professor into clear direction for the team.​
                The visual process followed a studio-style pipeline, starting with thumbnail explorations for the main poster, then advancing into roughs, comps, and two final iterations, with critiques at every stage. 
                This same iterative approach was applied to the supporting Instagram carousel, treating it as an extension of the key art rather than a separate asset.​
                Within the campaign, a primary contribution was the LUCIFER poster and its accompanying Instagram campaign, establishing a darker visual identity that aligned with the narrative tone of the VR experience. 
                The project concluded with a live pitch presentation, showcasing the video campaign and the full visual system to classmates and the professor as a cohesive launch concept.​
